Defination -> 

polymorphism is the greek word whose meraning is "Same Object Having Many Behaviour " 

Types [Two] 

-> Compile Time Polymorphism  [Function Overloading]
-> Run Time Polymorphism  [Function Overriding] 



[FUNCTION OVERLOADING  -> ] 

        Whenever a class contains more than
        one method with same name different types of parameter called function overloading 

        other name of function overloading 
        [ Early Binding , Static Polymorphism] 

[FUNCTION OVERRIDING ->  ] 

        Whenever we writing method in base and derived class in such a way that 
        function name parameter must be same called Function overriding  

        other name of Function overriding 
        [Late Binding , Dynamic Polymorphism] 

        problem in Function Overriding  
        [ we can't call the base class function using the derived class object
         is known as Function overriding problem  ]
